# Course in Working with bacterial communities and populations

## General introduction

Microbial community structure and diversity, and population structure are fundamental aspects to understand evolution, niche adaptation and demographic history of bacterial species. As NGS sequencing has become cost effective and accessible, microbial community analysis through 16S rRNA gene sequencing has become popular tool. Moreover, sequencing populations of bacteria across the whole genome provides unprecedented resolution to investigate within-host evolution, transmission history, and population structure. During the one week course the students will learn and apply bioinformatic techniques to study microbial communities and performing population genetics. The goal is to become familiar with the analysis tools and to be able to utilize them in own research after the course. 

## Target group

This course is targeted at PhD and MSc students who are interested in using 16S rRNA gene-based profiling of microbial communities and/or performing bacterial population analysis using whole-genome sequencing.
